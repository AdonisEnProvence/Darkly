Links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts of 42 are of the form: `/index.php?page=redirect&site=<service>`.

We replaced the service with something else than `facebook`, `twitter` and `instagram`, to see if we could be redirected, for example, to Google website: `/index.php?page=redirect&site=google`.

We were not redirected to Google website, but we had found a flag!
